Inputs: It receives one or more input signals (data).
Weights: Each input has a "weight" associated with it. The weight signifies the importance of that input. A higher weight means that input is more influential.
Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI. Instead of explicitly programming rules, we give a machine lots of data and let it learn the rules and patterns itself.
Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML. It uses a specific technique called Artificial Neural Networks with many
